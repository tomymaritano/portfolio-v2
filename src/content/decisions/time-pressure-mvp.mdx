constraint: time_pressure
context: Need to ship a product feature in 2 weeks with unclear requirements
decision: Build the smallest thing that answers the real question

## The Situation

Stakeholders want a feature. The deadline is aggressive. Requirements keep shifting. You could build it "right" in 6 weeks, or ship something in 2.

## Options Considered

### Option A: Push back on timeline
**Pros:** Build it properly
**Cons:** Lose momentum, stakeholders lose trust, might miss market window

### Option B: Commit and cut scope aggressively
**Pros:** Ship fast, learn fast
**Cons:** Technical debt, might build wrong thing

### Option C: Build a throwaway prototype first
**Pros:** Validate before investing
**Cons:** "Prototypes" become production, double work

## The Decision

**Option B, but with a twist.**

Don't just cut scope—identify the one question this feature needs to answer. Build only what answers that question. Everything else is v2.

## The Framework

Ask: "If this feature succeeds, what will we know that we don't know now?"

That question reveals the core value. Build to that. Cut everything else.

## Example

**Request:** "Build a dashboard with user analytics"
**Real question:** "Are users actually using the new onboarding flow?"
**MVP:** A single number showing completion rate. No dashboard. Just the answer.

## Consequences

- Shipped in 1 week instead of 2
- Learned the onboarding flow was broken at step 3
- Never built the full dashboard (didn't need it)
- Some stakeholders initially disappointed, then grateful

## Lessons

1. **Features are hypotheses.** Treat them that way.
2. **The simplest thing that works is often simpler than you think.**
3. **Disappointment now beats wasted effort later.**
