I had a vague idea: "Something with automation for small businesses." One week later, I had a validated business concept, target market, pricing strategy, and go-to-market plan. Here's how AI made it possible.

## Day 1-2: Idea Refinement

Used Claude to brainstorm and narrow down the concept:
- What problems do small businesses face?
- Which ones involve repetitive tasks?
- Where is automation underutilized?

Landed on: Automated invoice reconciliation for freelancers.

## Day 3: Market Research

AI helped me:
- Find competitor products and their pricing
- Identify gaps in existing solutions
- Estimate market size
- Find relevant industry reports

## Day 4: Customer Discovery

Created survey questions and interview scripts with AI assistance. Reached out to 20 freelancers on LinkedIn. Got 8 responses.

## Day 5: Solution Design

Based on feedback, used AI to:
- Draft feature requirements
- Create a simple wireframe description
- Outline the technical architecture

## Day 6: Business Model

With Claude's help:
- Defined pricing tiers
- Calculated unit economics
- Created financial projections
- Drafted a pitch deck outline

## Day 7: Go-to-Market

Final day was about launch strategy:
- Content calendar for launch
- Email sequences
- Partnership opportunities

## The Verdict

AI didn't replace the thinking - it accelerated it. What would have taken a month of part-time work happened in one focused week.

The idea? Still in progress. But now I know it's worth pursuing.
