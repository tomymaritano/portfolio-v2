As a Product Manager building crypto and fintech products, I'm always looking for tools that can help me move faster without sacrificing quality. Claude Code has been a game-changer.

## The Problem

Traditional PM workflows involve a lot of context-switching:
- Writing specs in one tool
- Communicating with engineers in another
- Prototyping in yet another
- Documentation scattered everywhere

## How Claude Code Changed Everything

With Claude Code, I can:

1. **Prototype instantly** - Instead of waiting for engineering bandwidth, I can build working prototypes myself
2. **Write better specs** - By understanding the code, I write more precise requirements
3. **Debug faster** - When something breaks, I can investigate before pinging the team
4. **Automate the boring stuff** - Scripts for data analysis, report generation, you name it

## My Workflow

I use Claude Code for:
- Quick data transformations
- API explorations
- UI prototypes
- Documentation generation
- Code reviews (yes, as a PM)

## The Result

Shipping velocity increased. Communication improved. And I became a more technical PM without going back to full-time coding.

If you're a PM who wants to level up, give Claude Code a try. The learning curve is worth it.
