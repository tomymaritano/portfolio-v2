## The Problem

Users start habits but don't stick to them. Generic tracking apps show streaks but don't help users understand *why* they fail or succeed.

## The Constraint

**Time pressure + ambiguity.**

3-week sprint to MVP. No user research budget. Had to ship fast and learn from real usage.

## The Decision

Built a minimum viable habit tracker with one differentiator: **pattern detection**.

Instead of just showing "you missed 3 days", the app identifies patterns:
- "You typically skip on Mondays"
- "Your streak breaks after travel"
- "Morning habits have 2x completion rate vs evening"

## What Failed

### Assumption: "More data = better insights"

Reality: Users were overwhelmed. The first version showed 12 different metrics. Nobody understood them.

**What I learned:** Start with one insight. Make it actionable. Add complexity only when users ask for it.

## Technical Details
