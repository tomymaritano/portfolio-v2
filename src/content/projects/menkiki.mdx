## The Idea

A mobile app that uses your camera to scan food products and recommends nearby restaurants, cafes, or stores where you can find similar items or related cuisines.

## My Role

**Solo Developer** building the full stack:

- **Mobile App** — React Native with Expo for cross-platform development
- **Product Recognition** — Camera integration with barcode/image scanning
- **Location Services** — GPS-based recommendations for nearby places
- **UX Design** — Simple scan-and-discover flow

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Mobile | React Native, Expo |
| Recognition | Camera API, Barcode Scanner |
| Location | Geolocation API |
| Backend | Node.js (planned) |

## Current Status

This is an experimental project in active development. The goal is to create a seamless experience where users can:

1. **Scan** — Point camera at any food product
2. **Identify** — Recognize the product or cuisine type
3. **Discover** — Get personalized recommendations for nearby places

## What I'm Learning

- React Native performance optimization for camera features
- Integrating ML models for food recognition
- Building location-aware recommendation systems
