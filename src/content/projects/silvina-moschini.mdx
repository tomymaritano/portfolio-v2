## The Problem

The first Latin American woman to achieve unicorn status ($1B+ valuation) needed a digital presence matching her global influence—professional, multilingual, and built for speaking engagements.

## My Role

**Product Manager** — Led the platform development:

- **Product Strategy** — Defined site goals and feature priorities
- **Content Architecture** — Organized achievements, media, events
- **Stakeholder Management** — Aligned with PR, speaking bureau, and personal team
- **Launch Coordination** — Managed development timeline and quality

## The Solution

A personal brand platform showcasing achievements and driving speaking bookings:

1. **Professional Biography** — Career story and leadership philosophy
2. **Media Coverage** — Forbes, Bloomberg, Washington Post features
3. **Speaking Events** — Web Summit, fintech conferences, global stages
4. **Awards Gallery** — "Women in Tech Lifetime Achievement," LinkedIn Top Voice, Latina Powerhouse Top 100
5. **Booking Flow** — Easy path from discovery to engagement inquiry

## Platform Features

### Content Sections
- Dynamic news feed with latest press
- Video player with keynote highlights
- Animated award carousels
- Event calendar and past appearances
- Social media integration (LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube)

### Engagement

- Multi-language support (English/Spanish)

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Framework | Next.js |
| UI | Material-UI |
| Video | Custom player with controls |
| i18n | English + Spanish |
| Design | Responsive across all devices |

## Key Decisions

### Authority First

For a unicorn founder, the site needed to communicate credibility immediately.

**Decision:** Led with media logos and award badges above the fold. Let press coverage speak before personal claims.

### Speaking Conversion

Primary goal was booking inquiries.

**Decision:** CTAs strategically placed after credibility sections. User sees achievements → feels confident → takes action.

## What I Learned

- **Personal brands need product thinking** — Same UX principles apply: user journeys, conversion funnels, trust building
- **Authority is designed** — Logo placement, social proof, and content hierarchy all shape perceived expertise
- **Multilingual adds complexity** — Not just translation; it's cultural adaptation of messaging
