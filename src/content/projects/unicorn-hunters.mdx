## The Problem

Startup investing was exclusive to VCs and accredited investors. Regular people watched Shark Tank but couldn't actually invest. The opportunity was entertainment without action.

## My Role

**Product Manager & UX Manager** — Led digital product and experience:

- **Platform Strategy** — Defined how the show's digital presence converts viewers to investors
- **UX Management** — Designed engagement flows from episode to investment
- **Content Integration** — Aligned video content with interactive features
- **Audience Analytics** — Tracked viewer behavior to optimize conversion

## The Solution

A media platform that bridges entertainment and investment:

1. **Episode Streaming** — Professional TV content featuring startups
2. **Cast Profiles** — Celebrity hosts and expert panelists
3. **Investment Gateway** — From watching to participating
4. **Community Features** — Engage with other aspiring investors
5. **News & Press** — Coverage from Forbes, CNN, Yahoo, Axios

## Platform Features

### Content Experience
- Episode carousel with preview functionality
- Cast member showcases
- Behind-the-scenes content
- Newsletter for episode updates

### Engagement Flows
- Contact forms for startup submissions
- Investment interest capture
- Social media integration
- Community building tools

## UX Challenges

### Entertainment + Finance

Two very different user mindsets. Entertainment wants passive consumption; finance requires active decision-making.

**Solution:** Designed a funnel—let users enjoy content first, then progressively introduce investment opportunities.

### Credibility Balance

TV show format could seem gimmicky for serious investors.

**Solution:** Emphasized press coverage (Forbes, Bloomberg), professional production value, and expert panelist credentials.

## Tech Implementation

| Feature | Technology |
|---------|------------|
| UI Framework | Material-UI + React |
| Video | Swiper carousel |
| Forms | Custom submission flows |
| Design | Gold (#FCD144) accent theming |

## What I Learned

- **Media is distribution** — Combining content with product creates powerful acquisition channels
- **Entertainment lowers barriers** — Complex topics become accessible through storytelling
- **Conversion requires trust** — From viewer to investor is a trust journey, not just a funnel
