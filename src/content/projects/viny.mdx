## The Problem

Note-taking apps force a tradeoff: cloud-based tools sacrifice privacy and offline access, while local apps lack modern features like semantic search and extensibility. Power users need both.

## My Role

**Founder & Developer** — Conceived and built the entire application:

- **Product Vision** — Defined the offline-first, privacy-focused approach
- **Architecture Design** — Structured the plugin system and data layer
- **Full Development** — Electron, frontend, and semantic search implementation
- **UX Design** — Crafted the writing experience and notebook organization

## The Solution

A cross-platform Markdown editor built for serious note-takers:

1. **Offline-First** — All data stored locally, works without internet
2. **Hierarchical Notebooks** — Organize notes in nested folder structures
3. **Tag System** — Flexible categorization across notebooks
4. **Semantic Search** — Find notes by meaning, not just keywords
5. **Plugin Architecture** — Extend functionality without core modifications

## Technical Architecture

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Framework | Electron |
| Frontend | React |
| Editor | Markdown with live preview |
| Search | Semantic embeddings |
| Storage | Local filesystem |
| Plugins | Modular extension system |

## Design Decisions

### Offline-First Philosophy

**Decision:** Local storage as the source of truth, sync as optional layer.

**Reasoning:**
- Privacy: Notes never leave your device unless you choose
- Reliability: No dependency on external services
- Speed: Instant access without network latency

### Hierarchical + Tags

**Decision:** Support both folder hierarchy AND tags.

**Reasoning:** Different mental models for different contexts:
- Hierarchies for project-based organization
- Tags for cross-cutting themes and quick filtering

### Plugin System

**Decision:** Build extensibility from day one.

**Reasoning:** Note-taking is personal. Instead of bloating the core with features, let users add what they need.

## Current Status

**Blocked** by Electron module resolution issue requiring migration to esbuild with externals configuration. The bundler needs to properly handle native Node modules in the Electron main process.

## Key Learnings

- **Electron is powerful but complex** — Native module resolution across main/renderer processes requires careful bundler configuration
- **Semantic search changes everything** — Finding notes by concept rather than exact text transforms how you organize information
- **Offline-first is a feature** — In an era of mandatory cloud sync, local-first is a competitive advantage for privacy-conscious users

## What's Next

- Resolve esbuild migration for Electron compatibility
- Implement sync layer (optional, encrypted)
- Launch beta for early adopters
