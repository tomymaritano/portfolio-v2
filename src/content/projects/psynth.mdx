## The Problem

Mental health professionals need efficient tools to manage patient psychological assessments. Existing solutions are often clunky, lack proper filtering, and don't provide clear visualization of assessment progress.

## My Role

**Frontend Developer** — Built the complete dashboard:

- Designed and implemented the entire UI architecture
- Created reusable component system with ShadCN UI
- Built advanced filtering and search functionality
- Implemented responsive design for desktop and mobile

## The Solution

A modern assessment management dashboard that streamlines the workflow:

1. **Statistics Overview** — Real-time metrics for total, completed, and in-progress assessments
2. **Advanced Filtering** — Debounced search, status filters, type filters, and date range presets
3. **Responsive Views** — Table view for desktop, card view for mobile
4. **Detail Panel** — Slide-over panel with score visualization using custom gauge component
5. **Polish** — Loading skeletons, empty states, and smooth transitions

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Framework | React 19 |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Build Tool | Vite |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| Components | ShadCN UI (Radix primitives) |
| Testing | Vitest + React Testing Library |

## Architecture

Centralized state management through a custom `useAssessments` hook:

- Eliminates prop drilling
- Separates business logic from UI components
- Makes testing straightforward
- 19 comprehensive tests covering filtering, pagination, and selection

## What I Learned

- **React 19 features** — Explored the latest React capabilities in a production context
- **ShadCN + Radix** — Building accessible, composable UI components efficiently
- **Testing patterns** — Writing meaningful tests for filtering logic and user interactions
