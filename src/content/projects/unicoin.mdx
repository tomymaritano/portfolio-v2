## The Problem

Cryptocurrency investment is complex and volatile. Traditional investors want crypto exposure but with real asset backing—not pure speculation.

## My Role

**Product Manager & UX Lead** — Led product strategy and design:

- **Product Strategy** — Defined platform vision and feature roadmap
- **UX Leadership** — Designed user journeys for complex financial flows
- **Cross-functional Coordination** — Aligned engineering, compliance, and business
- **User Research** — Identified investor pain points and opportunities

## The Solution

An investment platform combining crypto accessibility with real asset backing:

1. **Real Estate Portfolio** — Property investments tokenized on blockchain
2. **Emerging Growth** — Early-stage company exposure
3. **Portfolio Diversification** — Multiple asset classes in one platform
4. **Trust-First Design** — Transparency and credibility at every touchpoint

## UX Challenges

### Complex Flows Made Simple

Crypto + real estate + compliance = complexity. Designed progressive disclosure to onboard users without overwhelming them.

### Trust in Crypto

Crypto space has trust issues. Built credibility through:
- Clear asset documentation
- Media mentions (Forbes, Bloomberg, CNN)
- Regulatory compliance badges
- Real-time portfolio transparency

### Multi-Language Support

Global investor base required Spanish, Portuguese, and English—each with localized UX patterns.

## Key Decisions

### Onboarding Sequencing

**Challenge:** KYC requirements vs. user drop-off.

**Decision:** Let users explore before requiring verification. Show value first, ask for commitment second.

### Information Architecture

**Challenge:** Mixing crypto concepts with traditional finance.

**Decision:** Used familiar investment language, introduced crypto mechanics gradually.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | React + TypeScript |
| UI | CSS-in-JS (tss-react) |
| Carousels | Swiper.js |
| Design | Mobile-first responsive |

## What I Learned

- **Fintech trust is earned slowly** — Every design decision either builds or erodes credibility
- **Compliance shapes UX** — Regulatory requirements aren't obstacles; they're constraints to design within
- **Crypto UX is underserved** — Massive opportunity for designers who understand both finance and technology
