## The Problem

A 25-year-old premium transportation company needed a digital presence matching their service quality—professional, trustworthy, and easy to book.

## My Role

**Frontend Developer** — Built the complete web platform:

- Multi-language support (Spanish/English)
- Service catalog and fleet showcase
- Booking inquiry flows
- Mobile-responsive design
- WhatsApp integration for quick contact

## The Solution

A corporate website that converts visitors into clients:

1. **Service Pages** — Corporate transfers, airport pickups, VIP assistance, tourism
2. **Fleet Showcase** — Mercedes-Benz, Jeep, vans with specs and capacity
3. **Trust Signals** — 25+ years experience, Alvear Palace Hotel partnership
4. **Easy Contact** — Phone, WhatsApp, email, and inquiry forms

## Services Highlighted

- **Corporate Transfers** — Executive transport for companies
- **Airport Service** — Ezeiza, Aeroparque, San Fernando with flight tracking
- **VIP Assistance** — Lounge access and expedited service
- **Group Transport** — 15-60 passenger capacity
- **Armored Vehicles** — High-security options

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Framework | Next.js |
| Language | TypeScript |
| i18n | Spanish/English |
| Contact | WhatsApp API integration |
| Images | Next.js Image optimization |

## Design Approach

- Professional, corporate aesthetic
- High-quality vehicle photography
- Clear service categorization
- Prominent contact CTAs
- Trust badges and certifications

## What I Learned

- **B2B needs different UX** — Corporate clients want information density, not flash
- **WhatsApp is essential** — In Argentina, WhatsApp integration drives conversions
- **Bilingual from day one** — Tourism clients need English; retrofitting i18n is painful
