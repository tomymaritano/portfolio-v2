## The Problem

Travelers waste hours comparing prices across dozens of booking sites. Business class flyers pay retail prices when wholesale deals exist—but aren't accessible to consumers.

## My Role

**Product Designer & Engineer** — Owned the full product from concept to production:

- **Product Design** — User flows, wireframes, and visual design
- **Frontend Development** — Built the entire web application
- **API Integrations** — Connected multiple travel data providers
- **Production Deployment** — Infrastructure, monitoring, and optimization

## The Solution

A travel meta-search engine that aggregates results from multiple providers:

1. **Unified Search** — Flights, hotels, and car rentals in one interface
2. **Business Class Deals** — Wholesale airline tickets for premium cabins
3. **Real-time Comparison** — Prices from hundreds of sites simultaneously
4. **Smart Filters** — Narrow results by price, duration, stops, airline
5. **Bidding Dashboard** — Internal tool for users to bid on premium tickets

### Bidding Dashboard

Built a separate admin dashboard where users can:
- Submit bids for business/first class tickets
- Track bid status in real-time
- Receive notifications when bids are accepted
- View historical bid performance and savings

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Framework | Next.js |
| UI | Chakra UI |
| Rendering | SSR for SEO + fast initial load |
| APIs | Multiple travel aggregator integrations |

## Design Decisions

### Tab-based Navigation

Travel searches have distinct contexts (flights vs hotels vs cars). Instead of cramming everything into one form, I separated them into clear tabs—reducing cognitive load and error rates.

### Trust Signals

Travel is high-stakes purchasing. Added prominent trust indicators:
- "Searching 100+ sites"
- Clear price breakdowns
- Familiar airline/hotel logos

### Mobile-first Forms

Complex multi-field forms on mobile are painful. Prioritized touch targets, smart defaults, and progressive disclosure.

## What I Learned

- **Aggregator complexity** — Each travel API has different rate limits, data formats, and pricing models
- **Caching strategy matters** — Stale prices = angry users. Fresh prices = slow searches. Found the balance.
- **Conversion is in the details** — Small UX improvements (autocomplete, date pickers, clear CTAs) had outsized impact
