## Key Decisions

### Zustand over Redux

**Decision:** Zustand for state management.

**Reasoning:**
- Simpler API, less boilerplate
- Better TypeScript integration
- Smaller bundle size
- Perfect for e-commerce state (cart, wishlist, theme)

### Design Tokens

**Decision:** Custom design token system over raw Tailwind.

**Reasoning:**
- Easy theming for buyers
- Consistent spacing, colors, typography
- One config file to customize entire look

### Comprehensive Testing

**Decision:** 48+ unit tests + E2E + Storybook.

**Reasoning:**
- Buyers expect quality
- Tests document expected behavior
- Storybook serves as component documentation

## What Makes It Sellable

1. **Complete** — Not a starter, a finished product
2. **Tested** — 48+ tests prove reliability
3. **Documented** — Buyers can customize easily
4. **Performant** — Lighthouse 100 SEO, 87+ performance
5. **Modern Stack** — Next.js 14, TypeScript, latest practices

## What I Learned

- **Templates are products** — Quality bar is higher than personal projects
- **Testing sells** — Buyers trust tested code
- **Documentation is UX** — How easily can someone customize this?
- **Lighthouse matters** — Scores are marketing material
