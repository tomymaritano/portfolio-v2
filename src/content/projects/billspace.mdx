## The Problem

The average Dutch household manages 15+ subscriptions and overpays €50/month. For expats and newcomers, this is worse—navigating unfamiliar providers, contracts in Dutch, and complex cancellation processes.

## My Role

**Product Manager** leading the full product lifecycle:

- **Discovery & Research** — User interviews with expats, refugees, and social entrepreneurs to understand pain points
- **Roadmap & Prioritization** — Defined MVP scope and feature backlog based on impact vs effort
- **Sprint Planning** — Coordinated cross-functional team (design, dev, QA) in 2-week sprints
- **Stakeholder Management** — Aligned business goals with user needs across multiple stakeholders

## The Solution

A freemium platform that centralizes subscription management:

1. **Unified Dashboard** — All subscriptions in one place with payment reminders
2. **Document Storage** — Secure upload of contracts and bills
3. **Spending Analytics** — Visual breakdown of where money goes
4. **Personalized Offers** — AI-driven recommendations for better deals
5. **Expert Support** — Advisory for comparing, starting, or canceling services

## Hard Decisions

### Platform Complexity

The biggest challenge was managing integrations with multiple Dutch service providers—each with different APIs, data formats, and authentication methods.

**Decision:** Start with manual data entry + OCR for documents, then iterate toward automated integrations based on user adoption patterns.

### Freemium Balance

Defining what goes in free vs premium tier without killing conversion or user trust.

**Decision:** Free tier covers core value (tracking + reminders). Premium unlocks analytics and personalized savings recommendations.

## What I Learned

- **Localization matters** — A multilingual app isn't just translation; it's cultural context
- **Trust is everything** — For financial apps targeting vulnerable populations, transparency beats feature velocity
- **MVP ≠ minimal** — For this audience, MVP needed to feel complete and trustworthy from day one
