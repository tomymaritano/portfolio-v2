## The Problem

Social media makes documenting life easy—but at a cost. Endless scrolling, algorithmic feeds, and data harvesting turn precious memories into engagement metrics. People want to capture moments without the distractions.

## My Role

**Product Manager** leading product strategy and UX improvements:

- **Product Strategy** — Defined roadmap and feature prioritization
- **User Flow Redesign** — Improved key journeys for better retention
- **Feature Scoping** — Balanced user needs with development constraints
- **Cross-functional Coordination** — Aligned design, engineering, and business goals

## The Solution

A private memory app—social media UX without the social media downsides:

1. **Personal Timeline** — Document moments for yourself, not followers
2. **Smart Search** — Find memories by date, text, or custom tags
3. **Daily Featured Moments** — Resurface meaningful entries automatically
4. **Cloud Backup** — Secure storage without data exploitation
5. **Privacy First** — No ads, no data selling, no algorithmic manipulation

## UX Redesign Impact

### Onboarding Flow
Simplified first-time experience to reduce drop-off. Focused on immediate value—users create their first memory within 60 seconds.

### Memory Capture
Streamlined the capture interface to minimize friction between "moment happening" and "moment saved."

### Discovery
Redesigned how users rediscover old memories—balancing serendipity ("On This Day") with intentional search.

## Key Decisions

### Privacy vs Features

Premium features like sharing with family created tension with the core privacy promise.

**Decision:** Sharing is opt-in, end-to-end encrypted, and never affects the algorithm. Privacy remains the default.

### Simplicity vs Power

Power users wanted advanced organization (folders, albums, tags). Casual users wanted zero friction.

**Decision:** Tags are optional, search is smart enough to work without them, and organization emerges naturally from usage patterns.

## Platforms

- iOS (App Store)
- Android (Google Play)

## What I Learned

- **Emotional products need emotional onboarding** — First impression isn't about features, it's about feeling
- **Privacy is a feature** — In a post-social-media world, "we don't sell your data" is a competitive advantage
- **Retention beats acquisition** — For memory apps, users who stay 30 days stay forever
