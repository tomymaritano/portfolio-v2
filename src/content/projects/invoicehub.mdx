## The Problem

Small businesses in LATAM still use Excel for invoicing. Local tax regulations are complex. Existing solutions are expensive or don't support regional requirements.

## The Constraint

**Legacy systems + stakeholder conflict.**

Had to integrate with 4 different tax authorities, each with different APIs (some SOAP, some REST, some FTP uploads). Business stakeholders wanted features, compliance team wanted audit trails.

## The Decision

Built a modular architecture where each country's tax integration was a separate plugin. Core invoicing logic stayed clean. Compliance requirements isolated to dedicated modules.

## What Failed

### Assumption: "Abstract the complexity away"

Reality: Tax rules change constantly. Our abstraction became a liability. When Argentina changed their electronic invoicing format, we had to rewrite the entire integration.

**What I learned:** Some domains resist abstraction. Sometimes copy-paste with clear boundaries is more maintainable than clever abstractions.

## Why Archived

Market shifted. Bigger players entered with subsidized pricing. We couldn't compete on price and decided to shut down gracefully.
