## The Problem

Argentina has multiple dollar exchange rates. Official sources are unreliable. APIs fail constantly. Users need real-time data they can trust.

## The Constraint

**Bad data everywhere.**

Every public API for Argentine exchange rates has issues:
- Delayed updates (sometimes hours)
- Incorrect values during high volatility
- Downtime during market hours
- Inconsistent data formats

## The Decision

Instead of trusting any single source, I built a system that:

1. **Aggregates multiple sources** - Cross-references 5+ APIs
2. **Detects anomalies** - Flags values that deviate from consensus
3. **Falls back gracefully** - Uses cached data with clear timestamps
4. **Shows uncertainty** - Displays confidence levels, not false precision

## What Failed

### Assumption: "More sources = better accuracy"

Reality: More sources meant more edge cases. Some APIs update at different times. Some have bugs during weekends. The "consensus" was often wrong.

**What I learned:** Quality of sources matters more than quantity. I ended up weighting sources by historical reliability.

### Assumption: "Users want the most accurate number"

Reality: Users want to know if they can trust the number. A value with "updated 2 minutes ago, high confidence" is more useful than a "precise" number with unknown freshness.

## What I'd Change Today

- Start with fewer, higher-quality sources
- Build the confidence display from day one
- Add user-reported corrections as a signal

## Technical Details

```
Architecture: DB-first, not API-first
Stack: Next.js, Supabase, Edge Functions
Update frequency: 30 seconds during market hours
Fallback: Cached values with decay indicators
```
