## The Problem

Argentina's economic context is highly volatile. Financial information is scattered and inconsistent: multiple dollar exchange rates, inflation, country risk, and key indicators appear fragmented, with unclear definitions and difficult comparisons.

People making financial decisions—from small savers to businesses—lack a single source of truth.

## My Role

**Founder** — Built the entire product from zero:

- **Vision & Strategy** — Defined the product direction and market positioning
- **Problem Research** — Deep-dived into user pain points around financial data
- **Roadmap & Prioritization** — Decided what to build and when
- **Development** — Designed and built the platform end-to-end
- **User Experience** — Transformed complex data into clear, actionable information

## The Solution

A data-driven fintech platform that consolidates Argentina's key financial indicators:

1. **Multiple Dollar Rates** — Blue, MEP, CCL, official, and more in one view
2. **Real-time Updates** — 30-second refresh during market hours
3. **Data Reliability** — Cross-references 5+ sources with confidence indicators
4. **Historical Context** — Trends and comparisons over time
5. **Actionable Insights** — Not just numbers, but what they mean

## Technical Architecture

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Framework | Next.js |
| Database | Supabase |
| Processing | Edge Functions |
| Updates | 30-second intervals |
| Fallback | Cached values with decay indicators |

### Data Strategy

**DB-first, not API-first.** Instead of trusting any single source:

- Aggregate multiple sources
- Detect anomalies and flag deviations
- Weight sources by historical reliability
- Show uncertainty transparently

## Key Learnings

### "More sources ≠ better accuracy"

More sources meant more edge cases. Some APIs update at different times. Some have bugs during weekends. The "consensus" was often wrong.

**Solution:** Quality over quantity. Weight sources by historical reliability.

### "Users want trust, not precision"

A value with "updated 2 minutes ago, high confidence" is more useful than a "precise" number with unknown freshness.

**Solution:** Built confidence displays from day one. Transparency beats false precision.

## Iteration Philosophy

The platform is alive—constantly iterated based on real usage and user feedback. Data-driven decisions about the product that provides data-driven decisions.

## What I'd Change

- Start with fewer, higher-quality sources
- Add user-reported corrections as a signal earlier
- Build community features for power users
