## The Problem

Artisanal furniture designers needed an online presence that matched the quality and craftsmanship of their pieces—not generic e-commerce templates.

## My Role

**Frontend Developer** — Built the complete web experience:

- Custom Next.js implementation
- Product catalog with detailed specifications
- Responsive design across all devices
- Image optimization for large furniture photography
- SEO optimization for search visibility

## The Solution

A minimalist e-commerce platform that lets the furniture speak:

1. **Curated Catalog** — Products organized by collection and designer
2. **Rich Product Pages** — Dimensions, materials, finishes, and color options
3. **Designer Profiles** — Showcasing collaborations (Oscar Maschera, Arte Brotto, Pieter Adams)
4. **Colorsense Collection** — Nine exclusive wood finishes with visual swatches

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Framework | Next.js |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| Images | Next.js Image optimization |
| Fonts | Bricolage, Crimson, Inter |

## Design Approach

- Large hero imagery that showcases craftsmanship
- Monochromatic palette letting products be the color
- Grid-based layouts for product discovery
- Subtle animations enhancing premium feel

## What I Learned

- **Photography is UX** — For furniture, image quality directly impacts perceived product value
- **Whitespace sells** — Minimalist design increases time on page for luxury products
- **Performance matters** — Heavy images need smart loading strategies
