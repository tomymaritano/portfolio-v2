## The Problem

Fitness enthusiasts in Argentina needed a reliable source for premium shakers and supplements with fast local delivery and clear product information.

## My Role

**Developer** — Built the complete e-commerce platform:

- **Platform Setup** — Configured Tiendanube for Argentine market
- **Theme Development** — Custom styling and branding
- **Product Catalog** — Organized supplements, shakers, and accessories
- **Checkout Flow** — Optimized for local payment methods

## The Solution

A sleek e-commerce platform for premium fitness products:

1. **Product Categories** — Shakers (Elite, Pro, Stack), supplements, hydration, accessories
2. **Fast Delivery** — 24-hour shipping to Buenos Aires metropolitan area
3. **Bundle Deals** — Curated combo packages for better value
4. **Affiliate Program** — Built-in referral system for growth

## Technical Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Platform | Tiendanube |
| Carousels | Swiper.js |
| Typography | Plus Jakarta Sans |
| Analytics | Google Analytics 4 |
| Security | reCAPTCHA v2 & v3 |
| Currency | Argentine Peso (ARS) |

## Design Approach

Minimalist aesthetic matching the premium product positioning:

- **Color Palette** — Black and white with orange accent (#ff5a00)
- **Typography** — Clean, modern Plus Jakarta Sans
- **Layout** — Responsive product grids
- **Navigation** — Simple category hierarchy

## Key Decisions

### Platform Choice

**Decision:** Tiendanube over custom build.

**Reasoning:** For e-commerce in Argentina, Tiendanube provides:
- Local payment gateway integrations (Mercado Pago, etc.)
- Built-in shipping calculators for Argentine logistics
- Established trust signals for local buyers

### Visual Identity

**Decision:** Minimal design with orange accents.

**Reasoning:** Premium fitness products need clean presentation. Let the product photography do the work; UI should be invisible.

## What I Learned

- **Local platforms win** — Argentine e-commerce has unique payment and shipping needs; local solutions handle edge cases better
- **Speed sells** — 24-hour delivery promise is a competitive advantage worth engineering for
- **Trust signals matter** — Stock indicators and delivery estimates reduce purchase anxiety
