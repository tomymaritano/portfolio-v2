## The Problem

Traditional learning platforms depend on centralized payment processors with high fees and geographic restrictions. Communities seeking financial sovereignty needed an alternative that aligned with their values.

## My Role

Started as **Developer**, evolved to **Product Manager**:

### As Developer (Svelte)
- Built custom frontend components in Svelte
- Integrated Lightning Network payment protocol
- Developed crypto payment flows for course purchases

### As Product Manager
- Defined product roadmap and feature priorities
- Coordinated between community needs and technical constraints
- Managed the transition from traditional to crypto-native payments

## The Solution

A hybrid community-learning platform with decentralized payments:

1. **Learning Management** — Structured courses with progress tracking and certificates
2. **Community Groups** — Members organize around shared interests
3. **Member Profiles** — Networking and connection features
4. **Lightning Payments** — Instant, low-fee Bitcoin payments for courses and memberships

## Lightning Integration

Implemented Lightning Network protocol for:

- **Course purchases** — Pay for individual courses or bundles
- **Membership tiers** — Subscribe with recurring Lightning payments
- **Instant settlement** — No waiting for payment confirmation
- **Global access** — Anyone with Bitcoin can participate, regardless of banking access

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | Svelte |
| Payments | Lightning Network Protocol |
| Platform | WordPress + BuddyPress + LearnDash |
| Design | Custom theme with Elementor |

## Challenges

### Crypto UX

Lightning payments are technically superior but UX is unfamiliar to most users.

**Solution:** Built a guided payment flow with clear instructions, QR codes, and fallback options for users new to crypto.

### Hybrid Architecture

Integrating Svelte components into a WordPress ecosystem required creative bridging.

**Solution:** Built Svelte as micro-frontends that communicate with WordPress via REST API.

## What I Learned

- **Web3 UX is the bottleneck** — The tech works; the onboarding doesn't. Simplify ruthlessly.
- **Community-first products** — Features should emerge from member needs, not roadmap assumptions
- **Payment sovereignty matters** — For certain communities, how you pay is as important as what you pay for
