## The Problem

Creative agencies need portfolios that demonstrate their capabilities without overshadowing client work. The website itself becomes proof of concept.

## My Role

**Frontend Developer** — Built the studio's digital presence:

- Next.js application with dynamic project pages
- Cloudinary integration for optimized image delivery
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Project case study templates
- Contact and inquiry flows

## The Solution

A portfolio platform showcasing Blacro's three pillars:

1. **Marketing & Strategy** — Campaigns, brand storytelling, content strategy
2. **Branding & Design** — Visual identity, packaging, web design, art direction
3. **Experiences** — Service design, brand activations, events

## Notable Client Work Displayed

- **Private Limo** — Visual rebranding for premium transport
- **Myrica Gin** — Packaging design
- **London Fashion Week** — Event production
- **YouTube Connect Mexico** — Experiential design
- **Unicoin** — Crypto campaign direction

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Framework | Next.js |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| Images | Cloudinary (adaptive resolution) |
| Components | React with custom animations |

## Design Philosophy

The site balances showcasing client work while maintaining Blacro's own visual identity:

- Dark, sophisticated palette
- Large-scale project imagery
- Smooth page transitions
- Case study deep-dives

## What I Learned

- **Portfolio sites are products** — They need the same UX rigor as any SaaS
- **Image optimization is critical** — Creative portfolios are image-heavy; Cloudinary solved delivery at scale
- **Let work speak** — The best agency sites get out of the way of the projects
