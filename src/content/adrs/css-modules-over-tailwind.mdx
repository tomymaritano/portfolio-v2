## Context

When redesigning the portfolio, I evaluated different styling approaches. The main contenders were Tailwind CSS and CSS Modules with a custom design system.

## Decision Drivers

- **Control**: Wanted precise control over the design system
- **Performance**: Zero runtime overhead
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Learning**: Opportunity to deepen CSS knowledge

## Considered Options

### Tailwind CSS
- Rapid development with utility classes
- Consistent spacing and colors
- Large community and ecosystem
- Potential for cluttered markup

### CSS Modules + Custom Properties
- Full design system control
- Clean component markup
- Native CSS features
- More setup work

## Outcome

CSS Modules with custom properties was chosen. Benefits realized:
- Design system is explicit and documented in CSS variables
- Components have clean, semantic class names
- Easy to maintain consistent theming (light/dark modes)
- No build-time or runtime CSS processing overhead
