## Context

When building a fintech application that handles financial transactions, data integrity is paramount. We evaluated MongoDB and PostgreSQL as primary database options.

## Decision Drivers

- **Data Integrity**: Financial data must be consistent and accurate
- **ACID Compliance**: Transactions need atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability
- **Query Flexibility**: Complex reporting and analytics requirements
- **Team Expertise**: Team had more experience with SQL databases

## Considered Options

### MongoDB
- Flexible schema for rapid iteration
- Horizontal scaling built-in
- Document model fits some use cases

### PostgreSQL
- Strong ACID guarantees
- Mature ecosystem
- Excellent JSON support when needed
- Better for relational data

## Outcome

PostgreSQL was chosen. After 6 months in production:
- Zero data inconsistencies
- Complex queries perform well with proper indexing
- Schema migrations handled smoothly with tools like Prisma
