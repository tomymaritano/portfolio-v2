## Context

The portfolio was using Next.js Pages Router. With the stable release of App Router and React Server Components, it was time to evaluate a migration.

## Decision Drivers

- **Performance**: Server components reduce client bundle size
- **Developer Experience**: Colocation of data fetching and components
- **SEO**: Better metadata handling out of the box
- **Future Proofing**: App Router is the recommended approach going forward

## Considered Options

### Stay with Pages Router
- Familiar patterns
- All libraries work
- No migration effort

### Migrate to App Router
- Modern React patterns
- Better performance potential
- Improved DX for many use cases

## Outcome

Migrated to App Router. Key learnings:
- Server components significantly reduced JavaScript sent to client
- Data fetching at component level simplified architecture
- Streaming improved perceived performance
- Some refactoring needed for client-side interactivity
